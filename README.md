TODO LIST :
Implementing Dijkstra algorithm "IMPLEMENTED"
Implementing A* algorithm "IMPLEMENTED"
Implementing a Caching system for the maps ( BOOST PROBLEM )
Writing code for XBOX 360 controller support (gotta buy wired controller )
Implementing path-smoothing ( raycasting ) 
Writing the base code for the entity class
ReWriting the player class 
Writing the enemy class
Finishing AI ( states and stuff )

Milestones

This is the public repository for the VectorShooter project.
It is a 2D top-view shooter, where you can costumize the enemy AI.
Features that will be introduced
Choose the enemy pathfinding algorithm
- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- A*
+ path smoothing

Choose all the states for the FMS
- wander 
- attack
- rush 
etc.... ( will updated this later ) 

game Modes
- DeathMatch ( classic ) 
- NightMathc ( night mode with limited view ) 
- HardCore ( how long will you survive ? )
